# GeocachingApp

Play Geocaching with 10 predefined Geocaches. 

### Build the App

The App was made with React Native and Expo. The easiest way to build the App yourself is to clone the Project. Then run

```
npm install
```
and get yourself a GoogleMaps API key from [Google Maps Platform]( https://mapsplatform.google.com/). <br>
Then add this API key in the app.json file. You should then be able to build the app by following these [steps](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/). <br>
Keep in mind that this project was mainly developed for Android phones, so you might need some extra configuration to run the app on another OS.
